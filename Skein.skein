Barn
Joe and Babalu stand by in the barn. Jack sits in a chair by a table and stove. You can go into your room, Joe Bonecrusher&apos;s Room, the Doves&quot; Room, and the Kitchen. You could also go outside, even though it&apos;s really cold.

Now that you have collected all the materials you need, you can cut off Jack&apos;s fingers. You review what you had learned at Tao Chi&apos;en&apos;s side when he had extracted bullets and stitched up wounds in Sacramento…The most important thing was to prevent hemorrhaging and infection. Although you have not watched him do any amputations, but when he was treating unlucky patients whose ears had been cut off, he had commented that in other lands they cut off hands and feet for the same crime. &quot;The executioner&apos;s ax is quick, but it doesn&apos;t leave any tissue to cover the stump of the bone,&quot; Tao had told you. You know that all you need to do now is cut off the fingers, clean up the blood, then stitch up the stumps. It would probably be safer if you disinfected the knife first; heating it up would do the trick.

The dresser&apos;s large and made from some wood you don&apos;t recognize. You don&apos;t have the key to it and Joe probably wouldn&apos;t give it to you. There are probably other ways to get into it though.

Joe and Babalu stand by in the barn. Jack sits in a chair by a table and stove. You can go into your room, Joe Bonecrusher&apos;s Room, the Doves&quot; Room, and the Kitchen. You could also go outside, but it&apos;s freezing and probably not a good idea.
